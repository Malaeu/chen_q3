\subsection{Summary}

We supply fully analytic modules for the Archimedean barrier (A3), the RKHS prime contraction, and the compact transfer (T5), together with explicit monotone schedules. These ingredients prove positivity of $H_K=T_{M^\star(K)}[P_A]-T_P$ on every compact $W_K$ with certified parameters and show how positivity would extend along any exhaustion. The global conclusion $Q(\Phi)\ge0$ on the full Weil class---and thus RH via Weil---depends on propagating these bounds through the exhaustion; this remains an open analytic step. The GRH twist and the twin-prime sector inherit the same status: their operator identities are proved, but GRH and TPC themselves are not.

\subsection{Outlook}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sharpen constants in the Archimedean bounds (Lemma~\ref{lem:psi-upper}) to optimize $M_{\min}(K)$.
    \item Extend the analytic RKHS contraction to general Dirichlet characters $\chi \bmod q$ uniformly in $q$.
    \item For twin primes: either (i) derive analytic lower bounds for the twin-restricted $Z(X)$, or (ii) supply the conjectural inputs in \cref{thm:pc-hl2} (pair correlation $+$ HL(2)), or keep the bridge explicitly conditional.
    \item Close the remaining global step: extend the compact positivity bounds uniformly along an exhaustion of $\mathcal{W}$ without auxiliary assumptions.
\end{itemize}
