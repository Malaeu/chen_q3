# Trace-Formula to Spectral-Gap Pipeline (Anantharaman--Monk)

Purpose
- Legitimize the spectral/trace-formula language used around the Weil criterion.
- Not a technical dependency; serves as a genre-level comparator.

Borrowed pattern
- Length spectrum + trace-formula technology -> spectral gap lower bounds.
- Clear separation between geometric input and spectral output.

Where it shows up in Q3
- Contemporary context paragraph in `sections/introduction.tex`.
- Supports the narrative that "trace/explicit formula -> spectral positivity" is a standard pipeline.

Notes for writing
- Disambiguate terms: "Weil--Petersson" (moduli space) is unrelated to the Weil criterion.
- Use as framing, not as a proof ingredient.
