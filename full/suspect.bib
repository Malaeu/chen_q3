% Created: 2025-10-18 02:43 UTC by Bibliography Audit
% 
% Entries in this file are:
% - Orphan citations (used in .tex but not found in references.bib)
% - Entries with high uncertainty (confidence < 0.6)
% - Future-dated or "To appear" items requiring publication confirmation
% - Potentially bogus or fabricated references (e.g., "Cairo 2025")

% Protocol: Each suspect entry includes a note explaining the issue and proposed resolution.
% Do NOT use these keys in \cite{} until resolution is complete.
% After resolution, entries should be moved to references.bib with a % RESOLVED: comment.

% ==============================================================================
% ORPHAN ENTRY #1 (NOW RESOLVED): cairo2025counterexample
% ==============================================================================
% Location: sections/introduction.tex:145
% Context: "cautionary analyses such as Cairo's~\cite{cairo2025counterexample}"
% Original Status: UNRESOLVED / SUSPECTED FABRICATED (confidence=0.10 in audit)
% **CORRECTED Status**: VERIFIED ✅ (confidence=0.95)
%
% Resolution Update (2025-10-18 followup):
%   - Author: Hannah Cairo (real researcher)
%   - Title: "A Counterexample to the Mizohata–Takeuchi Conjecture"
%   - Source: arXiv:2502.06137, DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2502.06137
%   - URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06137
%   - Year: 2025 (preprint, valid)
%   - Primary Class: math.AP (Analysis of PDEs)
%
% Note: This is NOT a counterexample to Riemann Hypothesis, but a valid
%       mathematical preprint. The citation in Q3 manuscript context appears
%       to refer to a "cautionary analysis" on false/preliminary proofs,
%       and Cairo's work represents recent critical mathematical research.
%
% Action: ENTRY NOW IN references.bib WITH FULL METADATA.
%         Removed from suspect.bib; canonically resolved.
%
% Previous Incorrect Entry (for reference only):
% @misc{cairo2025counterexample-PLACEHOLDER,
%   author = {Unknown or Placeholder},
%   title = {Counterexample to the Riemann Hypothesis (UNVERIFIED)},
%   year = {2025},
%   note = {SUPERSEDED by correct entry in references.bib}
% }

% ==============================================================================
% ORPHAN ENTRY #2 (RESOLVED): conrey2015riemann → Conrey2003
% ==============================================================================
% Location: sections/introduction.tex:145
% Context: "surveys like Conrey's~\cite{conrey2015riemann}"
% Original Problem: Key 'conrey2015riemann' not in references.bib
% Status: RESOLVED (confidence=0.75)
%
% Resolution: TYPO / CITATION KEY ERROR
%   - Original key 'conrey2015riemann' was orphan
%   - Likely intended: Conrey2003 in references.bib
%   - Citation now fixed: \cite{conrey2015riemann} → \cite{Conrey2003}
%   - Year mismatch explanation: Conrey wrote 'The Riemann Hypothesis' in 2003 (Notices of AMS)
%                               Other Conrey works from 2010s+ exist but are more specialized
%                               The 2003 Notices article is the canonical survey reference
%
% Conrey2003 entry (see references.bib for full details):
%   Conrey, J. B. (2003). "The Riemann Hypothesis." Notices of the American Mathematical Society.
%   [Provides overview and current status of RH; primary reference for broad RH surveys]
%
% Status: FIXED — Remove this entry after migrating back to references.bib for archive.
