next_deliverable: the transform-side landing surface is now frozen in Lean: `Q3/Proofs/PO3Cert/PO3SquareSignedDominanceCertificate_2026_04_21.lean` names `po3_gamma_profile`, `PO3SquareTransformSideData`, and `PO3SquareTransformPacketCertificate`, so the next real attack is no longer certificate plumbing but the actual signed top-cluster / rightmost estimate on the real `A_k` tower against mirror suppression on `B_k`

This file is the operational single source of truth after the Q_zeta sprint is
closed.

## Startup response contract

If this file exists and `status: ACTIVE`, the first new-session message should
be:

```text
Фаза активна: <phase>, текущий шаг <current_step_id> — <current_step_title>.
Сейчас открываю <current_artifact> и добиваю <next_deliverable>; если blocker
не появится, другие control docs не перечитываю.
```

## Phase contract

- no return to coordination-first work unless the theorem phase stalls;
- lane `A` now treats the upper bridge `H2^f -> H3^f -> H4^f` as packaged but
  conditional, and therefore uses `PO3` as the first unresolved lower-shell
  proof packet back in `H1`;
- lane `B` stays frozen at the canonical smallest-block certificate;
- no rank/basis language as theorem content;
- no new RH architecture.
- parallel worker agents must read this file before any closed sprint monitor.

## Worker loop

If a parallel worker is used during this phase, it should:

- read `SESSION_ENTRY.md`;
- read this phase monitor;
- read `AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`;
- read `worker_request`;
- return a narrow result to the orchestrator;
- let the orchestrator maintain the canonical `worker_report`.

## Current step

### `PO3-square.2d3` — transform-side Gamma tower dominant-packet estimate

Goal:

- keep the lower-shell feeder
  `PO3-shell.5/.6 -> PO3a-A2-real -> PO3a.4-real -> PO3-rig.1b.cert-real -> PO3-tail.1-real -> PO3-square.2d0a/.1/.2`
  frozen and do not reopen it;
- use the already-frozen shell landing surface in
  `Q3/Proofs/HBridge_PO3_Shell.lean`
  and the new `PO3Cert` feeder
  `PO3SquareDominantPacketCertificate`
  as fixed interfaces, not as new mathematical work;
- treat the formula-localization pass and the transform-side landing surface as
  closed:
  `Y_a = {x_γ, x_γ - 1}` is already pinned to the old `PO2` note,
  the live `A_k/B_k` route language is already pinned to the `PO3` ladder,
  and the Gamma-profile ancestor
  `u_k(x) = (-1)^k Γ(N+1-x) / Γ(k+N+1-x)` is already pinned in
  `docs/INSIGHTS.md`,
  while the Lean packet
  `PO3SquareTransformPacketCertificate`
  already names the real `A_k`, `B_k`, and `Y_a` data expected by the future
  proof;
- attack the only live burden directly:
  derive one honest eventual lower bound for the signed main `A_k` tower from
  a real top-cluster / rightmost dominance mechanism strong enough to beat the
  suppressed mirror `B_k` side.

Required output:

- one real analytic packet estimate or one explicitly isolated obstruction for
  that estimate;
- one exact pointer from that estimate back into the already-frozen transform-
  side landing surface `PO3SquareTransformPacketCertificate`;
- one route-kill criterion if the actual tower admits genuine infinite-support
  signed self-cancellation that defeats rightmost dominance.

Exact success criterion:

- the next theorem attempt is one honest real packet estimate feeding the
  transform-side certificate landing surface, or one explicit obstruction that
  kills this route shape.

Exact failure criterion:

- if the actual transform-side formulas cannot be reconciled with the frozen
  dominant-packet certificate shape, record that incompatibility explicitly
  rather than reopening lower-shell architecture.

## Macro view

This phase should now be read in the compressed route language:

- Door 1 = `(+,-)` adapter:
  `P1` tail defect setup, `P2` bulk exactness, `P3` boundary cancellation;
- Door 2 = `(++)` boundary-plus-cap theorem block;
- Door 3 = compression neutrality;
- Final = `H2^f -> H3^f -> H4^f -> RH`.

Current position:

- `H1^f -> H2^f -> H3^f -> H4^f` is packaged tightly enough at theorem-shell level;
- RH is still not proved because that bridge remains conditional on unresolved
  `H1` proof input;
- the first real proof-critical gate on the route is still inside `PO3`,
  but its live mathematical point is now much narrower:
  `PO3-square.2d3`, the transform-side dominant-packet estimate on the actual
  Gamma tower.
