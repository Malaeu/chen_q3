# Proshka Reasoning-Time Log

Purpose: measure which Q3 proof nodes consume the most external-review
reasoning time.  This is an operational performance ledger, not proof
authority and not evidence that a theorem is proved.

## Recording contract

For each substantive request, append one entry with:

```yaml
proof_address:
front:
transaction:
request_message_id:
sent_at:
completed_at:
wall_seconds:
wall_human:
answer_now_shown:
answer_now_clicked: false
primary:
status:
result_pointer:
notes:
```

Use timezone-qualified ISO timestamps.  Measure from immediately before send
until generation actually completes.  Never click `Answer now`.  A timing row
does not change Lean, route, or roof status.

## Runs

### 2026-08-04 — G5 cofinal third-even root bracket source audit

```yaml
proof_address: G5_MODE4_R1A
front: G5/S1
transaction: G5_MODE4_R1A_COFINAL_THIRD_EVEN_ROOT_BRACKET_SOURCE_LOCK
request_message_id: 7e4fe1b8-815b-4142-a2be-95d19b9d7b17
sent_at: backfill_unavailable
completed_at: RUNNING
wall_seconds: RUNNING
wall_human: RUNNING
answer_now_shown: true
answer_now_clicked: false
primary: PENDING
status: RUNNING
result_pointer: PENDING
notes: >-
  First run registered after it had already started. Preserve only a
  conservative lower bound at completion; do not invent an exact send time.
  Timing instrumentation began at 2026-08-04T22:30:25+02:00
  (Unix 1785875425), after more than seven observed minutes of generation.
